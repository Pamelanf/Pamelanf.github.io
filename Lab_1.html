						<p>

						In this laboratory, we are going to analyse the Employee Data Base with MySQL, to do that first we need to install MySQL server on
						our machines, there are many sources on the internet where you can find a guide to install it, one I found easy to follow is
						<a href = "https://www.mysqltutorial.org/install-mysql/" target="_blank"> 'https://www.mysqltutorial.org/install-mysql/'</a>
						; once we installed our MySQL server we can continue with Part A and B of this lab.

						</p>

						<h3>  Part A:  </h3>

						<p>
						Download the Employee DataBase which is available at the following link:
						<a href = "https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db" target="_blank"> 'https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db'</a> </br></br>

						Download the entire directory as a zip (use the clone or download dropdown option).Once downloaded, unzip the file and put in
						the working directory, in my case
						<font size="2"> 'C:\Users\Pamela\Desktop\PROJECTS\PORTFOLIO\PROJECTS\1RO LAB\test_db-master'.</font> <br/><br/>

						Before to import the data in your MySQL server, first we need to do some modifications into the employees.sql file otherwise we are going
						to have problems loading the dump files, then having said this, open employees.sql with any notepad and go to the bottom to modify the source
						lines for  example in the first source line is written <font size="2">  'source load_departments.dump;' </font>
						instead, put  the whole path working directory as
						<font size="2"> 'source C:\Users\Pamela\Desktop\PROJECTS\PORTFOLIO\PROJECTS\1RO LAB\test_db-master\load_departments.dump;'</font> <br/><br/>

						Once we have done this we can import with the source command line, in 'mysql' shell: <br/><br/>
						<font size="2">  mysql> source C:\Users\Pamela\Desktop\PROJECTS\PORTFOLIO\PROJECTS\1RO LAB\test_db-master\ employees.sql </font> <br/><br/>

						The Employees sample database provides a combination of a large base of data (approximately 160MB) spread over six separate tables and consisting
						of 4 million records in total. For more details check the following link:
						<a href = "https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/" target="_blank"> 'https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/'</a> </br></br>

						Where you can see the structure of these tables as follow:

						<h3>  Part B:  </h3>
						<p>
						In this section, we are going to write appropriate SQL statements to answer each of the following questions, but firstly
						let's explore the databases tables:</br></br>

						<font size="2">  mysql>  show tables; </font>
						</p>

						<center><img src="images/thumbs/Lab 01_B.jpg" alt="" style="width:300px;height:200px;"></center>

						<p>

						The above graphic shows 8 tables however 6 of these tables are the base table (the tables are fixed in the structure) and
						2 are view tables(virtual tables), see the following graphic.

						<font size="2"> mysql> show full tables; </font>

						<center><img src="images/thumbs/Lab 01_C.jpg" alt="" style="width:300px;height:200px;"></center>

						</p>

						<H3> Questions:</H3>

						<p>
						1)	Show all available job position titles. </br></br>

						<font size="2">  mysql> SELECT DISTINCT title FROM titles; </font>
						</p>

						<center><img src="images/thumbs/Lab 01_D.jpg" alt="" style="width:400px;height:800px,"></center>

						<p> <span style="font-weight:bold"> Explanation:</span> In this question, we use the title table and 'SELECT DISTINCT' statement to return only different values of
						the available positions.
						</p>

						<p>
						2)	How many employees work on each position. </br></br>

						<font size="2">  mysql> SELECT title, COUNT (title) FROM titles GROUP BY title; </font>
						</p>

						<center><img src="images/thumbs/Lab 01_E.jpg" alt="" style="width:450px;height:850px,"></center>

						<p> <span style="font-weight:bold"> Explanation:</span> Here, we use the title table and these are grouped for title to count into these groups.
						</p>

						<p>
						3)	What is the average salary for each position? Order the results from the highest average to the lowest.</br></br>
						<font size="2">  mysql> SELECT titles.title, AVG(salaries.salary) AS 'AVERAGE SALARY' FROM titles INNER JOIN salaries ON
						titles.emp_no = salaries.emp_no GROUP BY titles.title ORDER BY AVG(salaries.salary) DESC;  </font>
						</p>
						<center><img src="images/thumbs/Lab 01_F.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px;height:850px,"></center>

						<p> <span style="font-weight:bold"> Explanation:</span> To answer this question we joined the 'titles' and 'salaries' tables, using INNER JOIN statement, then group by titles to have
						the average of each position then sorting out from the highest to the lowest value.
						</p>

						<p>
						4) Show all departments' name together with the first and last names of department's manager. Sort the list by the last name of the manager.</br></br>
						<font size="2">  SELECT departments.dept_name, employees.first_name, employees.last_name FROM departments INNER JOIN dept_manager ON
						departments.dept_no = dept_manager.dept_no INNER JOIN employees ON dept_manager.emp_no = employees.emp_no INNER JOIN titles ON
						employees.emp_no = titles.emp_no WHERE titles.title = 'manager' ORDER BY employees.last_name ASC;  </font>
						</p>
						<center><img src="images/thumbs/Lab 01_G.jpg" alt="" style="width:550px;height:850px,"></center>

						<p> <span style="font-weight:bold"> Explanation:</span> To answer this question, the departments, dept_manager and employees tables were joined, and we filter by selecting just the manager
						position (title).
						</p>

						<p>
						 5) Modify the previous query to show only the current manager of each department. A manager is a current manager if the to date column
						 is equal to "9999-01-01".</br></br>
						<font size="2"> SELECT departments.dept_name, employees.first_name, employees.last_name FROM departments INNER JOIN dept_manager ON
						departments.dept_no = dept_manager.dept_no INNER JOIN employees ON dept_manager.emp_no = employees.emp_no INNER JOIN titles ON
						employees.emp_no = titles.emp_no WHERE titles.title = 'manager' AND titles.to_date = "9999-01-01" ORDER BY employees.last_name ASC; </font>
						</p>
						<center><img src="images/thumbs/Lab 01_H.jpg" alt="" style="width:600px;height:850px,"></center>

						<p> <span style="font-weight:bold"> Explanation:</span> This is the same as the previous question but we added a filter more '  titles.to_date = '9999-01-01''.
						</p>

						<p>
						6) What is the average current salary for each position?
									</br></br>
						<font size="2"> SELECT titles.title, AVG(salaries.salary) as 'AVERAGE SALARY' FROM titles INNER JOIN salaries ON titles.emp_no
						= salaries.emp_no WHERE titles.to_date = "9999-01-01" GROUP BY titles.title; </font>
						</p>
						<center><img src="images/thumbs/Lab 01_I.jpg" alt="" style="width:600px;height:750px,"></center>

						<p> <span style="font-weight:bold"> Explanation: </span> This question is similar to question 3 but it is filtered by the current position as 'titles.to_date = '9999-01-01''..
						</p>

						<p> 7) How many Assistant Engineers currently earn more than the average salary of all current employee?.
															</br></br>
						<span style="font-weight:bold"> Explanation:</span> To have an idea, first we will query to return a table with the all Assistant Engineers (currently) and their salaries:
						<font size="2"> SELECT titles.titles, salaries.salary FROM titles INNER JOIN salaries ON titles.emp_no = salaries.emp_no WHERE titles.titles
						= 'Assistant Engineer' and titles.to_date = "9999-01-01"; </font>
						</p>
						<center><img src="images/thumbs/Lab 01_J.jpg" alt="" style="width:300px;height:250px,"></center>

						<p> Second query, the average salary of all current employee.</br></br>
						<font size="2"> SELECT AVG(salary) FROM salaries WHERE to_date = "9999-01-01";</font>

						</p>
						<center><img src="images/thumbs/Lab 01_K.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px;height:450px,"></center>

						<p> <span style="font-weight:bold"> FINAL QUERY: </span> </br></br>
						<font size="2"> SELECT COUNT(*)FROM titles INNER JOIN salaries ON titles.emp_no = salaries.emp_no WHERE titles.title = ‘Assistant Engineer’
						and titles.to_date = "9999-01-01" and salaries.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM salaries WHERE to_date = "9999-01-01");</font> </br></br>

						Finally, we nest the second query into the first query, the results as shown below.
						</p>

						<center><img src="images/thumbs/Lab 01_L.jpg" alt="" style="width:600px;height:650px,"></center>

						<p>
						8) Show all identifiers of departments that have more than 40000 employees.
						</br></br>
						<font size="2"> SELECT departments.dept_no FROM departments INNER JOIN dept_emp ON departments.dept_no = dept_emp.dept_no INNER JOIN
						employees ON dept_emp.emp_no = employees.emp_no GROUP BY departments.dept_no HAVING COUNT(employees.emp_no)>40000;</font>
						</p>
						<center><img src="images/thumbs/Lab 01_M.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px;height:750px,"></center>

						<p> <span style="font-weight:bold"> Explanation:</span> In this question, we join three tables and we filter our result using the 'HAVING' statement as the 'WHERE' statement could
						not be used with aggregate functions like count.
						</p>

						<p>
						9) Is there a difference in the average salaries for males and females?
						</br></br>
						<font size="2"> SELECT employees.Gender, AVG(salaries.salary) FROM salaries INNER JOIN employees ON  salaries.emp_no = employees.emp_no GROUP BY
						employees.gender;</font>
						</p>
						<center><img src="images/thumbs/Lab 01_N.jpg" alt="" style="width:600px;height:750px,"></center>

						<p> <span style="font-weight:bold"> Explanation: </span> As the table shows it is slightly different. Here basically we use INNER JOIN to join employees and salaries tables
						to have the average salary and group by gender.
						</p>

						<p>
						10) Show first name, last name, salary and title of all employees with the salary between 38000 and 39000. Sort them by the salary.
						You want to present only the current job title.
						</br></br>
						<font size="2"> SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name, salaries.salary, titles.title FROM employees INNER JOIN salaries ON
						employees.emp_no = salaries.emp_no INNER JOIN titles ON employees.emp_no = titles.emp_no WHERE salaries.salary >= 38000 and salaries.salary
						<=39000 AND titles.to_date ='9999-01-01' SORT BY salaries.salary;</font>
						</p>
						<center><img src="images/thumbs/Lab 01_O.jpg" alt="" style="width:600px;height:550px,"></center>

						<p> <span style="font-weight:bold"> Explanation: </span> the employees, salaries, and titles tables were joined then we filtered the result with the conditions established in
						the question to finally sort out by salary to the lowest to the highest.
						</p>






						<h3> IV)	INFERENCE:</h3>

						<p> In this laboratory we learnt how to install MySQL server, load the Employees DataBase in MySQL server, and perform queries over this  DataBase,
						using main SQL statements such as INNER JOIN, HAVING, ORDER by, and others.
